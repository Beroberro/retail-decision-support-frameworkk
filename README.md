# Retail Decision Support Framework

This repository presents a SQL- and Tableau-based decision support framework developed for retail and e-commerce analytics. The project demonstrates how structured transactional data can be transformed into actionable managerial insights through database querying, customer-level analysis, and interactive visual dashboards.

The framework was developed as part of an academic dissertation and focuses on customer behaviour analysis using revenue, purchase frequency, and recency metrics.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To demonstrate how SQL-based analysis can be used to extract meaningful insights from retail transaction data  
- To design interactive Tableau dashboards that support managerial decision-making  
- To analyse customer behaviour using descriptive analytics techniques  
- To integrate database querying and visual analytics into a coherent decision support framework  

---

## Analytical Framework

The framework is built around three core analytical dimensions commonly used in retail analytics:

- **Revenue**: Total monetary contribution of customers  
- **Purchase Frequency**: Number of completed transactions per customer  
- **Recency**: Time elapsed since the most recent purchase  

These dimensions are analysed individually and jointly to support customer segmentation and behavioural insight generation.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL** – data extraction, aggregation, and customer-level metrics  
- **Tableau** – interactive dashboards and visual analytics  
- **GitHub** – version control and project documentation

## Data Source

The analysis is based on an online retail transactional dataset commonly used for academic research.  
Raw data files are not included in this repository due to file size and academic usage constraints.

---

## Dashboards

The Tableau dashboards developed in this project include:

- Revenue distribution by country and product  
- Customer purchase behaviour and value segmentation  
- Recency and customer engagement analysis  

Links to the interactive Tableau Public dashboards are provided in the `dashboards/README.md` file.

## Academic Context

This project was developed for academic purposes and forms part of a postgraduate dissertation in data analytics. The framework emphasises interpretability, transparency, and practical relevance over complex predictive modelling.
